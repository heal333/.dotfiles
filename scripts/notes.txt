Constructor in is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally.
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

CDN = content delivery network

react-dom(createRoot, createPortal) is for modifying the dom
react elements are just objects. Becomes html elements when we render it
order matters for multiple script tags
reactelement.render() will replace everything in the reactelement
react can work in specific part of an webpage
npm is NOT node package manager
bundler: vite, parcel, webpack(create-react-app uses this)
devDependency used in development phase only and not in production build
in package.json:
  ^(caret)  = Compatible with version, willl update to all future minor/patch verisons that are
              backwards-compatible without incrementing the mazor verison.
  ~(tilde)  = Approximately equivalent to version, will update future patch that area
              backwards-compatible without incrementing the minor version.
transitive dependency: indirect dependency.
every dependency has its own package.json btw.
HMR: Hot Module Replacement
tree shaking in percel
npx: executing an npm package
JSX: HTML-like syntax in js, bundler will transpile this code. (eg: the bable inside percel)
JSX => React.createElement => JS Object => HTML element(root.render)
JSX prevents cross site scripting(XSS) attacks btw
you can just execute a react component cause its just an function
config driven UI
list of elements needs a key property to identify it uniquely and add new element in that list for optimized rendering. So it dosent need to rerender every element in the list when a new element is added.
not reccomended to use index as a key otherwise it could cause order issue
default export and named export
hooks are javascript function provided by the react library
dom(document object model):tree like structure of the html elements
virtual-dom: representation of an actual dom.
optional chaining in js.
useState creates a local state variable in our functional component
useEffect without a dependency array is called after every render
if we return a function in useEffect that function is called when that componenent is unmounted;
Link behind the scenes is an anchor tag
life cycle of class componenent in React: 
1. Constructor (render phase)
2. render (render phase)
3. componentDidMount (commit phase) //this will execute after all child and all sibling component life cycle is done too cause optimization
4.componentDidUpdata //after every subsequent update
5.componentWillUnmount //just before unmounting

Lazy Loading/On demand loading/ dynamic import:
const ComponentWithLazyLoading = lazy(()=> import("path to the component"))
<Suspense fallback={temporary component}><ComponentWithLazyLoading /></Suspense>

higher order component: takes an component and returns an component

node.js Tyan Dahl, 2009 , initially known as web.js
node.js: cross platform, open-source, javascript runtime environment with event driven architecture and asynchronous I/O

ECMAScript is a standard for scripting language including js
js engine follows ECMAScript standard

global object in node.js is global (provided by environment)
  this refers to {} in node.js

global object in browser js is window. 
  this,self,window,frames refers to window object in browser

globalThis is the standard for all js runtime environment to refer to the global object

3median = mode +2mean
mode can be multivalued  & cant be 1
need mean for standard deviation. 
standard deviation = root of average of squered differance between mean and element
variance = standard deviations**2
for 9n squered: jitne 9 unse 1 kam 9, jitne 9 unse 1 kam 0, bich me 81 laga dena mere hero
for 9n cubed: jitne 9 unse 1 kam 9, jitne 9 unse 1 kam 0, bich me 72 laga dena mere hero, end with jitne 9.

dividend = (divisior*quotient) + remainder

divisibility rules:
  4: last 2 digit should be divilible by 4 or should be 00
  7:
  8:last 3 digits should be dibisible by 8 or should be 000
  9:the sum of all the digits of the number should be divisible by 9
  11:the difference of the odd sum and even sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 11

interior angles sum = (n-2)*180
interior angles(regular figure) = interior angles sum / n

area of equilataral triangle = (root(3)/4)*a**2

inradius = area/semi perimeter
circumradious = product of sides/(4*area)

for right angle triangle:
  inradius = (base+perpendicular-hypoteneaus)/2
  circumradious = hypoteneaus/2
  
for equilataral triangle:
  inradius = a/(2*root(3))
  inradius = height/3
  circumradious = a/root(3)
