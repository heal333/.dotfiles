3median = mode +2mean
mode can be multivalued  & cant be 1
need mean for standard deviation. 
standard deviation = root of average of squered differance between mean and element
variance = standard deviations**2
for 9n squered: jitne 9 unse 1 kam 9, jitne 9 unse 1 kam 0, bich me 81 laga dena mere hero
for 9n cubed: jitne 9 unse 1 kam 9, jitne 9 unse 1 kam 0, bich me 72 laga dena mere hero, end with jitne 9.
square of 9 1s (111111111) = 12345678987654321
dividend = (divisior*quotient) + remainder

divisibility rules:
  4: last 2 digit should be divilible by 4 or should be 00
  7:
  8:last 3 digits should be dibisible by 8 or should be 000
  9:the sum of all the digits of the number should be divisible by 9
  11:the difference of the odd sum and even sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 11

interior angles sum = (n-2)*180
interior angles(regular figure) = interior angles sum / n

area of equilataral triangle = (root(3)/4)*a**2

inradius = area/semi perimeter
circumradious = product of sides/(4*area)

for right angle triangle:
  inradius = (base+perpendicular-hypoteneaus)/2
  circumradious = hypoteneaus/2
  
for equilataral triangle:
  inradius = a/(2*root(3))
  inradius = height/3
  circumradious = a/root(3)
